# Balloteer ðŸ—³

Balloteer lets any community run verifiable, auditable votes from Telegram.

What works right now:
- /join flow: user asks to join voting
- admin approves and assigns weight
- /new creates a proposal
- voting happens in private DMs
- /close ends proposal and posts the result

Repo layout:
- bot.js          â†’ Telegram bot (grammy)
- backend/        â†’ Express API (future: connect Telegram user to Privy wallet)
- frontend/       â†’ Web app (future: login + wallet creation with Privy)

Next:
1. Deploy frontend to Vercel (gives us a free URL)
2. Use Privy for "Login with Telegram" to auto-mint a wallet
3. Store voter weight on-chain later (Solana)
